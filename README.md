## VISION & PURPOSE
**Business Problem:**
Fleet managers currently lack real-time visibility into vehicle locations, status, and predictive maintenance. This leads to breakdowns, delays, and higher operational costs due to reactive maintenance and inefficient manual tracking through spreadsheets.

**Target Users:**

- Primary: Fleet managers responsible for operations and vehicle uptime
- Secondary: Dispatchers/operations teams monitoring day-to-day activity
- Tertiary: Company leadership reviewing fleet performance dashboards

**Core Value Proposition:**
A centralized dashboard that provides real-time simulated data on fleet vehicles, predictive maintenance alerts, and KPIs for performance, helping managers reduce downtime, cut costs, and improve operational reliability.
